# CI

In this folder you can find CI jobs based on Azure pipelines.
These jobs make sure that `bazel build` and `bazel test` work across different compilers and operating systems.
An overview supported Microsoft-hosted agents can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml).
