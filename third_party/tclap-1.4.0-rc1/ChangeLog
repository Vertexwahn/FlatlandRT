# TCLAP 1.4

The 1.4 release of TCLAP contains many small improvements, but the main
changes are:

* xor args are deprecated in favour of *ArgGroup*s, a more feature
  rich and general purpose way to express constraints among args.
* The help output and argument parsing now more closely resembles that
  of the NetBSD style.
* Arguments can be hidden from the help text.
* Switched to cmake build system.

Most programs written for 1.2 should still continue to compile out of
the box, but there are some cases where minor API changes have been
made.
