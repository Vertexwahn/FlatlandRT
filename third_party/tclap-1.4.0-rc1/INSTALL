Basic Installation
==================

TCLAP is a header-only library, so on most modern systems you can
simply copy the .../include/tclap directory to your project, or simply
add .../include to the include path for the compiler. The path prefix
"..." here refers to the root directory of TCLAP (i.e., where you
cloned or extracted it).

CMake Installation
==================

TCLAP uses CMake (https://cmake.org/) to configure, build, test, and
install the library. If you have CMake installed on your system you
can build and install TCLAP in the following way (all commands
executed from the root TCLAP directory).

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cmake --install . [--prefix CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX]

This will try to detect some parameters for your system and create a
configuration file to match it. The last command will install the
headers in the default install location (requires CMake 3.15 or
later), you can specify an alternative install location with the
--prefix flag. For earlier versions you can use the platform install
command (e.g., `make install`).

After TCLAP has been installed, you can use it by adding the install
location to your compilers include path and define HAVE_TCLAP_CONFIG_H
to use the config picked up by the system. On most systems the
defaults are good enough and it is not necessary to rely on the
configuration detected by CMake - it is mostly used to work around
some old compiler and Windows issues.

VisualStudio Users
==================

VisualStudio can work with CMake, use the "File->Open Folder" option
to import the project into VisualStudio.
