              NASM, the Netwide Assembler.

Many many developers all over the net respect NASM for what it is
- a widespread (thus netwide), portable (thus netwide!), very
flexible and mature assembler tool with support for many output
formats (thus netwide!!).

Now we have good news for you: NASM is licensed under the "simplified"
(2-clause) BSD license.  This means its development is open to even
wider society of programmers wishing to improve their lovely
assembler.

The NASM project is now situated at SourceForge.net, the most
popular Open Source development site on the Internet.
